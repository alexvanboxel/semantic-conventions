# Event

## Event Attributes

Attributes for Events represented using Log Records.

| Attribute           | Type   | Description                                       | Examples                                                                    | Stability                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event.description` | string | Human-readable message representing an event. [1] | `User clicked element with id 42`; `Device app lifecycle changed to PAUSED` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `event.name`        | string | Identifies the class / type of event. [2]         | `browser.mouse.click`; `device.app.lifecycle`                               | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** Events are identified by an `event.name` and a set of attributes and fields in the body that carry specific meaning. However, since these events will be combined with other logs, `event.description` allows a centralized logging system to display a human-readable representation of the event.

**[2]:** Event names are subject to the same rules as [attribute names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.33.0/specification/common/attribute-naming.md). Notably, event names are namespaced to avoid collisions and provide a clean separation of semantics for events in separate domains like browser, mobile, and kubernetes.
