# Event

## Event Attributes

Attributes for Events represented using Log Records.

| Attribute       | Type   | Description                                       | Examples                                                                    | Stability                                                        |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event.name`    | string | Identifies the class / type of event. [1]         | `browser.mouse.click`; `device.app.lifecycle`                               | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |
| `event.summary` | string | Human-readable summary representing an event. [2] | `User clicked element with id 42`; `Device app lifecycle changed to PAUSED` | ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-experimental-blue) |

**[1]:** Event names are subject to the same rules as [attribute names](/docs/general/attribute-naming.md). Notably, event names are namespaced to avoid collisions and provide a clean separation of semantics for events in separate domains like browser, mobile, and kubernetes.

**[2]:** Events are identified by an `event.name` and a set of attributes and fields in the body that carry specific meaning. However, since these events will be combined with other logs, `event.summary` allows a centralized logging system to display a human-readable representation of the event.
When summaries are generated, they are not expected to include every attribute and field that is part of the event but could contain those that are meaningful for a human operator when visually navigating a centralized log system. Instrumentation libraries that produce events defined within the standard OpenTelemetry are not expected to add an `event.summary` attribute, as these are well-known events.
