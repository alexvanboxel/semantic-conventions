        note: >
          Event names are subject to the same rules as [attribute names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.33.0/specification/common/attribute-naming.md).
          Notably, event names are namespaced to avoid collisions and provide a clean
          separation of semantics for events in separate domains like browser, mobile, and
          kubernetes.
        examples: ['browser.mouse.click', 'device.app.lifecycle']

          Human-readable message representing an event.
        note: >
          Events are identified by an `event.name` and a set of attributes and fields in the body that carry specific
          meaning. However, since these events will be combined with other logs, `event.description` allows a
          centralized logging system to display a human-readable representation of the event.
        examples: ['User clicked element with id 42', 'Device app lifecycle changed to PAUSED']
