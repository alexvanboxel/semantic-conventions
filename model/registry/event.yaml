        note: >
          Event names are subject to the same rules as [attribute names](/docs/general/attribute-naming.md).
          Notably, event names are namespaced to avoid collisions and provide a clean
          separation of semantics for events in separate domains like browser, mobile, and
          kubernetes.
        examples: ['browser.mouse.click', 'device.app.lifecycle']

          Human-readable summary representing an event.
        note: >
          Events are identified by an `event.name` and a set of attributes and fields in the body that carry specific
          meaning. However, since these events will be combined with other logs, `event.summary` allows a
          centralized logging system to display a human-readable representation of the event.

          When summaries are generated, they are not expected to include every attribute and field that is part of the
          event but could contain those that are meaningful for a human operator when visually navigating a centralized
          log system. Instrumentation libraries that produce events defined within the standard OpenTelemetry are not
          expected to add an `event.summary` attribute, as these are well-known events.
        examples: ['User clicked element with id 42', 'Device app lifecycle changed to PAUSED']
